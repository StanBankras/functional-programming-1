# Functional Programming

*Functional Programming, a course of the Tech-track of Information Design, thema semester of the third year from the study CMD. In this course I will learn to clean raw data so it becomes usable.*

### Deliverable

An interesting research case and question based on parking data in cities in The Netherlands, including a digital data visualisation.

*The client for this assignment is [de Volkskrant](https://www.volkskrant.nl/), a very popular and big Dutch newspaper*

## Research Questions 

### Where is the ideal place to park if you have an electric car?

*For this question I assume that parking spaces with electric car are mostly in bigger cities, and that these spaces will be more expensive than parking spaces without support for electric car charging*

**Sub questions**

* How many parking spots are available for electric cars?

* Where is the most support for electric car charging in parking spaces?

* How expensive is the parking space?

#### What data am I going to need?

* [Charging points in parking facilities](https://opendata.rdw.nl/Parkeren/Open-Data-Parkeren-SPECIFICATIES-PARKEERGEBIED/b3us-f26s)
* [Tarifs of parking facilities](https://github.com/StanBankras/functional-programming/blob/7b103e400c03b80f58c1b2a4acc710a336ca5951/src/js/index.js#L70-L129) with huge credits to [Stan Bankras](https://github.com/StanBankras/) for creating the function for this
